# üèõÔ∏è big data symposium

A symposium is a gathering where people present, share, debate, and celebrate their current work on a unified topic. It's based on a [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium#/media/File:Paestum_tombeau_plongeur_c1.jpg) social institution (although the ancient original had more dancing, and significantly more drinking). In this class, you will pair up with another classmate to dive deeply into a topic of your choice within "big data" and scalable systems, and you will present your findings in 30 min. presentations in Weeks 10 + 11.

# üìö part 1: topic choice & bibliography

By **March 13th,** you will need to find a partner in class and choose a topic to research and present. You will need to turn in:
- an abstract paragraph describing the topic and subfield of your choosing
- a bibliography of sources that you will read (as a pair)

Your bibliography should include **@ minimum:**
- 2 academic research or industry white [papers](#where-do-I-find-research-papers)
- 1 book (you may find book chapters or books online)
- 2 related software tools with their documentation
- 3 non-scholarly articles (online, journalistic, etc.)
  
You may choose any topic relevant to this course - I am very flexible here! If you have a wild idea, run it by me! The topic must be deep enough that you can find the amount of sources required for the bibliography, but focused enough that you are not giving only a general overview. You also must include some technical material so that you are engaging with code in some way (and possibly giving a demo during your presentation). Here are a few topics to get you started thinking, but this is by no means an exhaustive list:
- Streaming Data Processing
- Persistence in Big Data
- Data Lake, Data Warehouse, Data Lakehouse
- Go (Golang) computer language (Google)
- Kubernetes, Containerization
- Serverless and FaaS Cloud Computing for Big Data
- Data Storage on the Blockchain (IPFS, etc.)
- Domain-Specific Implementation (science, health, justice, airlines, finance, media)
- Big Data for Discovery (check out the book _[The Fourth Paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fourth_Paradigm)_)
- Big Data + Disaster Response
- Security and Big Data
- Media Storage at Scale
- Environmental Impact of Big Data + Scalable Systems Infrastructure
- New Developments in Hardware (chips, etc.)
- Case Study (of a specific company or research project)
- PageRank, Search (Google)
- Platform-Specific (CUDA, AWS, Snowflake, Mesos, MongoDB, Tensorflow, etc.)
- New Development in LLMs, NLP, Generative AI ...
- Labor Issues in AI/Data: invisible human labor of training, etc...
- Social Impact: AI "For Good?," Algorithmic Bias, etc.
- Internet Archive, crawling
- Visualization of Big Data
- Artists Using Big Data
- Metaphors in Big Data, Critical Theory and Data, Memory, Labor ("worker"), etc.

### where do I find research papers?
- Google searches on your topic will take you far here, there are a lot of full PDFs available for download, especially for industry white papers.
- Other [databases of academic journals are available via CUNY libraries](https://www.cuny.edu/libraries/e-resources/) (JSTOR, etc.)
- You can also try searching [SpringerOpen](https://www.springeropen.com/), where you can search [Journal of Big Data](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/), etc. 

### what should the bibliography look like?
- The bibliography due on March 13th is just the list of sources, containing details like publication date, author, etc. 
- There are some good examples [here](https://www.scribbr.co.uk/referencing/harvard-bibliography/) and [here](https://guides.lib.unc.edu/citing-information/chicago-notes-sample)
- I am not requiring a specific format; Chicago, or Harvard, or APA, etc. are all fine. You can get help generating the bibliography entries at sites [like this one](https://zbib.org)

# üó£Ô∏è part ii: symposium presentation

On Weeks 10 + 11, your group will have **30 minutes** to make a presentation and engage the class in your research topic. By this point, you have been reading your bibliography and developing an in-depth understanding of your chosen subject, and this is the time to share your current, in-progress research with the class. The format is up to you - here are a few suggestions:
- 1 big 20-22 minute presentation with your partner, with some time for Q&A (teach us something!)
- 2 short presentations, 12 min. each, delivered by each team member, with some time for Q&A (you could deliver 1 techinical and 1 ethical perspective, or 2 use cases, etc., however you divide the work can be up to you)
- 1 30 min. technical demo, that you walk us through with a notebook in-class, like a lab
- 1 short presentation and 1 demo with code, delegate work between 2 partners
- 1 workshop: you could create questions and walk us through a structured discussion, create an activity for us to do on the board or on our machines, to engage with your topic
- 1 15 min. presentation and 1 10 min. video produced by your group, with some time for Q&A
- etc., etc.
- If you have a question about whether something will work for your presentation, please ask!

A few other things to remember:
- Time is important. If you leave 20 minutes for unstructured Q&A but your audience does not have questions, this will mean you did not present enough material.
- Similarly, if you have 1 hour's worth of material ...  **we will need to cut you off at 30 min!** _Practice_ your presentation so you know how much time you have and will need.
- **Speak to your audience**: this is not a general presentation, but a real event with a real audience of people you know! We have some shared experience with big data tools through this course, so we operate on a shared foundation. This is also a graduate-level course - so your introduction should be at a level that is challenging and interesting for your audience of peers.
- Show us some of your personality and your interest in the topic that you chose - how did you follow your curiosity to develop your research?
- You are not expected to be an expert at this point. You may also include your questions and your sense of "work-in-progress." Your classmates' feedback could help you determine the direction of further work.

Examples of ~30 min. talks:
- [Stanford Seminar, introduction to PyWren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkdKeoFYpn4) (serverless functions for big data) - this one is a little long but has a strong balance of introduction and techinical depth, classroom seminar setting very much like our goal
- [Cathy O'Neill, talks @ Google on her book _Weapons of Math Destruction_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQHs8SA1qpk) - good example of an informal style with depth/rigor, Q&A starts ~30 min.
- [Allison Parrish, workshop @ NYU Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoL0-JW4yjE) - creative, storytelling + technical explanations
- [Jovian, GPT tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVqsdTTKFd8) - combination of slide talk + code demo, learning a new tool
- [Claire Evans, Gray Area Festival talk on her book on women + history of computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwWTQ7LRRM) - great storytelling, great visuals

Deliverables + Grading:
- You will be evaluated on your presentation, in the following categories:
  - Engagement of the audience
  - Depth + rigor of research, utilizing your sources from your bibliography
  - Clarity of explanations
  - Visual aids: polished and helpful to your topic
- After your group presents, you will turn in a brief outline of your talk, your slides/visuals, and any code if you presented a demo

# üìë part iii: final 

As the final work in this class, you will be responsible for:

- 1 short (7 min. max) follow-up presentation, in-person on the last day of class, 1 presentation per group (May 15th)
- 1 annotated bibliography, 1 per group
- 1 short reflection, min. 500 words, 1 per person
- 1 continuation project _in the format of your choice_ - this could be group or solo work

üìΩÔ∏è **For the final presentation**, your group should tell us some of your next steps, where you have continued the research since your symposium presentation. Maybe there was an area of the research that you were not able to present in the 30 min.; maybe you became interested in 1 specific research question, narrowing your focus after the initial presentation. Show us "phase 2" of the research you have done for this class!

üìú **For the annotated bibliography**, you should take your initial sources list, and add any others that you have included in your research after you turned in your first bibliography. Then, for each source, provide a paragraph form summary of the resource (the book, the article, etc.), and a brief reflection on how this source helped (or did not help) you with the topic. You can see more information on how to write an annotated bibliography [here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/common_writing_assignments/annotated_bibliographies/annotated_bibliography_samples.html), and more full examples [here](https://libguides.csun.edu/research-strategies/annotated-bibliography). 1 annotated bibliography per symposium team.

‚ú® **For the reflection**, every person should turn in a 500-750 word informal paper, a personal reflection on how the division of labor went for your symposium team; how you personally showed up for the project work; and how you synthesized what you have learned in this class. In particular: how did our discussions on ethics, or the visit to the data center, relate to your learnings of the nuts and bolts of scalable computation? Which readings will stick with you? How do you think about Big Data and your role in this field going forward?

ü¶Ñ **For your final project!** This is open-ended - you have the chance to follow-up on the semester's research however you choose. You may work on something together with a small group in the class, or you may work solo. Some examples:
- final paper: literature review, ethics analysis, research report, etc. (if solo, minimum 6 pages; if group paper, minimum 12 pages)
- code project: you could turn in a notebook, website, etc. of _original_ code, working through a dataset based on your research, or creating an educational demo, etc.
- visualization: you could develop a visualization based on data related to your topic, in any format; include _original_ code
- video: produce an original tutorial, continue your presentation, show something new about your research; min. 10 minutes
- a combination of the above (shorter paper, but paper + code notebook, for example)
- have another idea? an art project, another form of writing or media? speculative fiction?! propose it! 

You will need to turn in a proposal for your final project (just a brief, informal Discord DM or e-mail telling me what you plan to create) by the end of the day (11:59pm) **Wednesday, May 1st.** You will receive brief feedback from me about the scope etc. and approval for the final üëç The final is due on **May 20th, by 11:59pm.**

**NOTE**: this final project work should avoid merely **_summary_** - if you are writing a paper, make sure you are adding your own original thoughts, questions, and arguments, do not simply summarize your sources! If you are creating a video, for example, a successful video for this class will not simply be a summary of what you learned about your topic. You will need to dig deeper: what are the unanswered questions about this topic that you have studied? What are potential solutions to big problems in big data? What are applications of the tools we have learned about? Etc. - please no "book reports" - that's what the annotated bibliography is for! If you have questions about this, please let me know when you turn in your proposal on May 1st.
