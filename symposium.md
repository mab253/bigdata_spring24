# üèõÔ∏è big data symposium

A symposium is a gathering where people present, share, debate, and celebrate their current work on a unified topic. It's based on a [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium#/media/File:Paestum_tombeau_plongeur_c1.jpg) social institution (although the ancient original had more dancing, and significantly more drinking). In this class, you will pair up with another classmate to dive deeply into a topic of your choice within "big data" and scalable systems, and you will present your findings in 30 min. presentations in Weeks 10 + 11.

# üìö part 1: topic choice & bibliography

By **March 13th,** you will need to find a partner in class and choose a topic to research and present. You will need to turn in:
- an abstract paragraph describing the topic and subfield of your choosing
- a bibliography of sources that you will read (as a pair)

Your bibliography should include **@ minimum:**
- 2 academic research or industry white [papers](#where-do-I-find-research-papers)
- 1 book (you may find book chapters or books online)
- 2 related software tools with their documentation
- 3 non-scholarly articles (online, journalistic, etc.)
  
You may choose any topic relevant to this course - I am very flexible here! If you have a wild idea, run it by me! The topic must be deep enough that you can find the amount of sources required for the bibliography, but focused enough that you are not giving only a general overview. You also must include some technical material so that you are engaging with code in some way (and possibly giving a demo during your presentation). Here are a few topics to get you started thinking, but this is by no means an exhaustive list:
- Streaming Data Processing
- Persistence in Big Data
- Data Lake, Data Warehouse, Data Lakehouse
- Go (Golang) computer language (Google)
- Kubernetes, Containerization (++ cloud infrastructure, popular in industry now)
- Data Storage on the Blockchain (IPFS, etc.)
- Domain-Specific Implementation (science, health, justice, airlines, finance)
- Big Data for Discovery (check out the book _[The Fourth Paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fourth_Paradigm)_)
- Big Data + Disaster Response
- Security and Big Data
- Media Storage at Scale
- Environmental Impact of Big Data + Scalable Systems Infrastructure
- New Developments in Hardware (chips, etc.)
- Case Study (of a specific company or research project)
- PageRank, Search (Google)
- Platform-Specific (CUDA, AWS, Snowflake, Mesos, MongoDB, Tensorflow, etc.)
- New Development in LLMs, NLP, Generative AI ...
- Labor Issues in AI/Data: invisible human labor of training, etc...
- Social Impact: AI "For Good?," Algorithmic Bias, etc.
- Internet Archive, crawling
- Visualization of Big Data
- Artists Using Big Data
- Metaphors in Big Data, Critical Theory and Data, Memory, Labor ("worker"), etc.

### where do I find research papers?
- Google searches on your topic will take you far here, there are a lot of full PDFs available for download, especially for industry white papers.
- Other [databases of academic journals are available via CUNY libraries](https://www.cuny.edu/libraries/e-resources/) (JSTOR, etc.)
- You can also try searching [SpringerOpen](https://www.springeropen.com/), where you can search [Journal of Big Data](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/), etc. 

### what should the bibliography look like?
- The bibliography due on March 13th is just the list of sources, containing details like publication date, author, etc. 
- There are some good examples [here](https://www.scribbr.co.uk/referencing/harvard-bibliography/) and [here](https://guides.lib.unc.edu/citing-information/chicago-notes-sample)
- I am not requiring a specific format; Chicago, or Harvard, or APA, etc. are all fine. You can get help generating the bibliography entries at sites [like this one](https://zbib.org)
