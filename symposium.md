# üèõÔ∏è big data symposium

A symposium is a gathering where people present, share, debate, and celebrate their current work on a unified topic. It's based on a [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium#/media/File:Paestum_tombeau_plongeur_c1.jpg) social institution (although the ancient original had more dancing, and significantly more drinking). In this class, you will pair up with another classmate to dive deeply into a topic of your choice within "big data" and scalable systems, and you will present your findings in 30 min. presentations in Weeks 10 + 11.

# üìö part 1: topic choice & bibliography

By **March 13th,** you will need to find a partner in class and choose a topic to research and present. You will need to turn in:
- an abstract paragraph describing the topic and subfield of your choosing
- a bibliography of sources that you will read (as a pair)

Your bibliography should include **@ minimum:**
- 2 academic research or industry white [papers](#where-do-I-find-research-papers)
- 1 book (you may find book chapters or books online)
- 2 related software tools with their documentation
- 3 non-scholarly articles (online, journalistic, etc.)
  
You may choose any topic relevant to this course - I am very flexible here! If you have a wild idea, run it by me! The topic must be deep enough that you can find the amount of sources required for the bibliography, but focused enough that you are not giving only a general overview. You also must include some technical material so that you are engaging with code in some way (and possibly giving a demo during your presentation). Here are a few topics to get you started thinking, but this is by no means an exhaustive list:
- Streaming Data Processing
- Persistence in Big Data
- Data Lake, Data Warehouse, Data Lakehouse
- Go (Golang) computer language (Google)
- Kubernetes, Containerization
- Serverless and FaaS Cloud Computing for Big Data
- Data Storage on the Blockchain (IPFS, etc.)
- Domain-Specific Implementation (science, health, justice, airlines, finance, media)
- Big Data for Discovery (check out the book _[The Fourth Paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fourth_Paradigm)_)
- Big Data + Disaster Response
- Security and Big Data
- Media Storage at Scale
- Environmental Impact of Big Data + Scalable Systems Infrastructure
- New Developments in Hardware (chips, etc.)
- Case Study (of a specific company or research project)
- PageRank, Search (Google)
- Platform-Specific (CUDA, AWS, Snowflake, Mesos, MongoDB, Tensorflow, etc.)
- New Development in LLMs, NLP, Generative AI ...
- Labor Issues in AI/Data: invisible human labor of training, etc...
- Social Impact: AI "For Good?," Algorithmic Bias, etc.
- Internet Archive, crawling
- Visualization of Big Data
- Artists Using Big Data
- Metaphors in Big Data, Critical Theory and Data, Memory, Labor ("worker"), etc.

### where do I find research papers?
- Google searches on your topic will take you far here, there are a lot of full PDFs available for download, especially for industry white papers.
- Other [databases of academic journals are available via CUNY libraries](https://www.cuny.edu/libraries/e-resources/) (JSTOR, etc.)
- You can also try searching [SpringerOpen](https://www.springeropen.com/), where you can search [Journal of Big Data](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/), etc. 

### what should the bibliography look like?
- The bibliography due on March 13th is just the list of sources, containing details like publication date, author, etc. 
- There are some good examples [here](https://www.scribbr.co.uk/referencing/harvard-bibliography/) and [here](https://guides.lib.unc.edu/citing-information/chicago-notes-sample)
- I am not requiring a specific format; Chicago, or Harvard, or APA, etc. are all fine. You can get help generating the bibliography entries at sites [like this one](https://zbib.org)

## üó£Ô∏è part ii: symposium presentation

On Weeks 10 + 11, your group will have **30 minutes** to make a presentation and engage the class in your research topic. By this point, you have been reading your bibliography and developing an in-depth understanding of your chosen subject, and this is the time to share your current, in-progress research with the class. The format is up to you - here are a few suggestions:
- 1 big 20-22 minute presentation with your partner, with some time for Q&A (teach us something!)
- 2 short presentations, 10 min. each delivered by each team member, with some time for Q&A (you could deliver 1 techinical and 1 ethical perspective, or 2 use cases, etc.)
- 1 30 min. technical demo, that you walk us through with a notebook in-class, like a lab
- 1 short presentation and 1 demo with code, delegate work between 2 partners
- 1 workshop: you could create questions and walk us through a structured discussion, create an activity for us to do on the board or on our machines, to engage with your topic
- 1 15 min. presentation and 1 10 min. video produced by your group, with some time for Q&A
- etc., etc.
- If you have a question about whether something will work for your presentation, please ask!

A few other things to remember:
- Time is important. If you leave 20 minutes for unstructured Q&A but your audience does not have questions, this will mean you did not present enough material.
- Similarly, if you have 1 hour's worth of material ...  **we will need to cut you off at 30 min!** _Practice_ your presentation so you know how much time you have and will need.
- Know your audience: this is not a general presentation, but a real event with a real audience of people you know! We have some shared experience with big data tools through this course, so we operate on a shared foundation. This is also a graduate-level course - so your introduction should be at a level that is challenging and interesting for your audience of peers.

Examples of ~30 min. talks:
- [Stanford Seminar, introduction to PyWren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkdKeoFYpn4) (serverless functions for big data) - this one is a little long but has a strong balance of introduction and techinical depth, classroom seminar setting very much like our goal
- [Allison Parrish, workshop @ NYU Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoL0-JW4yjE) - creative, storytelling + technical explanations
- [Jovian, GPT tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVqsdTTKFd8) - combination of slide talk + code demo, learning a new tool
- [Claire Evans, Gray Area Festival talk on her book on women + history of computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evwWTQ7LRRM) - great storytelling, great visuals
- [Cathy O'Neill, talks @ Google on her book _Weapons of Math Destruction_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQHs8SA1qpk) - good example of an informal style with depth/rigor, Q&A starts ~30 min.

Deliverables + Grading:
- You will be evaluated on your presentation, in the following categories:
  - Engagement of the audience
  - Depth + rigor of research, utilizing your sources from your bibliography
  - Clarity of explanations
  - Visual aids: polished and helpful to your topic
- After your group presents, you will turn in a brief outline of your talk, your slides/visuals, and any code if you presented a demo

NOTES on code/demo:
- If you do not include any code work or demo in your presentation, that is 100% up to you, a fine choice.
- However, if you do not include code in your presentation, you will need to include some technical work in your final project.
