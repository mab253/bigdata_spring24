# ðŸ¤– week 0: hello world, intro to big data exercise

To get in the habit of collaborative learning + teaching, in your small group take 30 min. to lightly research your assigned concept. General introductory overviews are fine here, Wikipedia, Google, etc. (unless I give you a specific source) - I recognize it's a short amount of time! After 30 min., each group will have about 5 minutes to present what they learned, and what they think the whole class should know in terms of big data.

I suggest:
- First research solo for 10-ish min.
- Come back to your small group and check in with what you found out - what is your understanding of the concept?
- Discuss with your group and plan how you will share the concept with the class, in a 5 min. mini informal presentation
- Then the class will be yours for 5 min.!

Group 1:
  - Moore's law, and the "end" or "death" of Moore's law

Group 2:

Group 3:
  - the "V's" of Big Data
  - start with "3 V's" and [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-big-data-concepts-and-terminology) ... but tell us a few more

Group 4:
  - [Critical Engineering Manifesto](https://criticalengineering.org/)
  - summarize your group's thoughts on this document, and if any 1 section relates most to big data or your own work
