# MapReduce: in-class exercise üó∫Ô∏èüîé

We will divide into groups to solidify our understanding of MapReduce. 

Every group will be in a breakout room in Zoom. 
- Take a corner of the [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNtAPTKw=/) for your group - give your group a name or a number and stake claim to a part of the board
- In that area, use the visual tools to talk through the processes of MapReduce as a group.
- Make sure you understand the distinct phases: Map, Shuffle/Sort, Reduce
- How will you visualize these steps? You can draw, write, use images, photos, etc. any way that you see fit.
- Choose a metaphor for MapReduce, a process from life, work, etc. that follows an analogous process. Illustrate this too in some way!
- Be ready to explain your visualizations to the larger group.

Check in with each other, and make sure you collectively understand the following:

1. What is the relationship between a distributed file system (HDFS, GFS) and MapReduce?
2. What does *abstraction* mean in the context of MapReduce as a programming model?
3. What is *data locality,* and how does MapReduce relate? How does this relate to rack awareness?
4. What does the manager node in MapReduce know?
5. Do MapReduce backup processes speed up or slow down the entire job?
6. What is the relationship between RAM and disk memory in MapReduce?
7. How does MapReduce typically decide what data gets partitioned where?
8. What does "atomic" mean in terms of MapReduce and data operations?
9. What does a programmer actually write in MapReduce? In what language?

If your group still has questions, take note of these, and bring them back to the larger group. You are encouraged to bring at least 1 question!
