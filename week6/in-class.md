# cloud: in-class exercise ☁️

We will divide into groups to work on a mini design sprint ... 

Every group will be in a breakout room in Zoom. 
- First, check in and say hi to your group.
- Now: take a corner of the [Miro board]([https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNtAPTKw=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNhU9TkA=/?share_link_id=816646626691)) for your group - give your group a name or a number and stake claim to a part of the board
- The task: how might you design a cloud-based MapReduce function for big data at a project like CERN? Say you want to add up all the values of a (GB! large) column of data on subatomic particle mass.
- Utilize event-driven, parallel serverless functions.
- Think about what triggers these functions - how you will make sure they run in parallel across a whole big batch dataset?
- Start by discussing your idea simply from what you know already from class, brainstorm with each other and be creative.
- This can be "high-level," building blocks of a system, not necessarily details of how queues work, etc.
- If you need/want, you can consult some of the resources from Week 6 - maybe check out the tools MARLA or PyWren ... 
- How will you visualize these steps? You can draw, write, use images, photos, etc. any way that you see fit.
- If time, choose a cloud provider service to "pitch" as one part of your system (for example, what could replace Digital Ocean? Twilio Functions? Quick internet research can help here!)
- Be ready to explain your visualizations to the larger group.
