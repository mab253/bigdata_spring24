# RDDs + Spark: in-class exercise ðŸ’¥

We will divide into groups to check in on our individual research, and solidify our understanding of RDDs and Spark. 

**Part I: ~15 minutes** 

Every group will be in a breakout room in Zoom. 
- First: each person take some solo time to write (on paper, or on notes on your own machine):
  - what are the key evolutions and improvements of Spark over earlier processing frameworks?
  - what are 1-2 questions you have about Spark and RDDs?
  - what are 1-2 current topics you are thinking about for your own research project?
- Choose a notetaker for the group. This person should open the class notes doc ([here](https://pad.riseup.net/p/4bH2z-2-BeDAz9blQlT_-keep))
- Share around the "room" your responses; the notetaker should add notes to the doc. If you can clarify a question that someone in your group has, please use this time to discuss it.
- Note: the chance to share your current research thoughts could help you choose partners for the symposium project ...

**Part II: ~20 minutes**

- Now: take a corner of today's [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNqatGC0=/) for your group - give your group a name or a number and stake claim to a part of the board
- Each group will have a topic to expand upon for Spark. Take time as a group to use the board and explain this concept visually; how does this concept relate to _performance_ in Spark?
  
  - Room 1: narrow vs. wide transformations
  - Room 2: lower vs. high-level APIs
  - Room 3: lineage graph and DAG
  - Room 4: walk us through the last graphs from the paper, Fig. 12/13/14

Be ready to share your visualizations and explanation of your group's topic with the larger group!
